How do you control for biases?\n","### Ans1. To control for biases, it's essential to design experiments or studies in a way that minimizes the influence of external factors and ensures that the results are as objective and unbiased as possible. This can be achieved by randomization, blinding, and careful experimental design to mitigate the impact of confounding variables and other sources of bias."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Hr_xjJNzozoj"},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ikv0vwzjozoj"},"source":["### Q2. What are confounding variables?\n","### Ans2. Confounding variables are extraneous factors that can influence the relationship between the independent and dependent variables in a study, leading to unauthentic associations. Controlling for confounding variables is crucial in research to ensure that the observed effects are genuinely attributable to the independent variable of interest and not to other factors."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ClfZAJVVozoj"},"source":["### Q3. What is A/B testing?\n","### Ans3. A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method used to compare two versions (A and B) of a webpage, advertisement, product feature, or other elements to determine which one performs better. It involves randomly assigning users to either version A or B and measuring the outcome of interest, such as click-through rates, conversion rates, or user engagement, to determine which version yields superior results."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4HXr2MSrozok"},"source":["### Q4. When will you use Welch t-test?\n","### Ans4. When the variances of the two groups are unequal, the standard Student's t-test may not provide accurate results. In such cases, Welch's t-test is preferred because it adjusts for the unequal variances by modifying the degrees of freedom used in the t-distribution."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9gQO-mI_ozok"},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4d2BWZrQozok"},"source":["### Q5. A company claims that the average time its customer service representatives spend on the phone per call is 6 minutes. You believe that the average time is actually higher. You collect a random sample of 50 calls and find that the average time spent on the phone per call in your sample is 6.5 minutes, with a standard deviation of 1.2 minutes. Test whether there is sufficient evidence to support your claim at a significance level of 0.05.\n","\n","### Ans5.\n","![IMG_1793.jpg](attachment:IMG_1793.jpg)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8YWIFozGozok"},"source":["### Q6.
